Major changes to the model.


6/1/2013
Population.SwitchgrassPop.append_Pop() line 524
/code/
'''
**********************************
@attention: 'SG_N' was SG_NH before,
meaning that part of the code never ran 
giving false results.
***********************************
'''
if self.run_code.startswith('SG_N'): 
	self.__getNonHarvHrsPerAcre__(harv_ac)
elif self.run_code.startswith('SG_H'):
	self.__getHarvHrsPerAcre__(harv_ac, prod)
else:
	self.__getTransportHrsPerAcre__(harv_ac, prod)
/end/
Comment: Changed SG_NH to SG_N. Before the the non harvest run code
was running as if it was the transport run code.

Population.CornGrainPop() line 244
Removed the *.1. because corng grain is a one year cycle
and not a 10 year cycle.
/Code/
'''
@deprecated: this is not a 10 year cycle!
harv_ac = dat[2] * 0.1    #10% of acres in each year of the 10-yr production cycle
prod = dat[3] / 10.0 
'''
harv_ac = dat[2]     
prod = dat[3]
/end/

Fertilizer.getFrtDistribution() line 59
Added function in order to either collect fertilizer distribution from the db,
or to allow the user to input their own distribution data.
/code/
'''
    Get fertilizer distribution. The user can either input their own distribution, 
    or use the predefined distribution on the db.
    @param fertDistribution: Distribution of the the five different fertilizers. 
    @return: Distribution of the five different fertilizers as a percentage. Must sum up to 1.
    Order: annhydrous_amonia, ammonium_nitrate, ammonium_sulfate, urea, nsol. (list(string))
    '''    
    def getFrtDistribution(self, fertDistribution=False):

CombustionEmissions.populateTables() line 100
Comment: The function CombustionEmissions._getDescription() was being called before
NH3 conversions were done. In this funciton it would set new values to these constants
only in the corn grain feed stock, and never convert the constants back to their normal
numbers. So the model would only run correctly if corn grain was ran last. Now the 
run codes can be used in any order.
/code/
# change constants back to normal, b/c they can be changes in _getDescription()
self.LHV = 128450.0 / 1e6  
self.NH3_EF = 0.68
self.vocConversion = 1.053
